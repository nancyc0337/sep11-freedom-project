# Presentation Plan

## Hook

* ask the audience a question if they ever thought of music, math, and games together

Question: Do you like music, math & games? Well, have you ever thought of them together?

## Product

Idea: either myself or choose a person from the audience (either student or Mr. Mueller) to play the game

## Process
* Learning Phaser
  * [Blog #1](https://github.com/nancyc0337/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry01.md)
  * [Blog #2](https://github.com/nancyc0337/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry02.md)
  * [Blog #3](https://github.com/nancyc0337/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry03.md)

  * What I learned:
    * `preload()` function is used to load the music and images into memory
    * `create()` function is used to add the objects to the game
    * `update()` function is an update, which is a loop that runs constantly, where all the physics & all the actions happens
    * scenes (how to activate them & how to move through each scenes)
    * audio (update music)

* MVP & Beyond MVP
  * [Blog #4](https://github.com/nancyc0337/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry04.md)
  * [Blog #5](https://github.com/nancyc0337/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/blog/entry05.md)

## Conclusion
* Takeaways
  * Problem decomposition: breaking a task down into smaller pieces
    * Breaking the MVP down into smaller tasks really helped me complete the project. (Making the instructions, settings, levels, characters scenes...)
  * Debugging: reading errors, tinkering, talking through the problem (RDD)
    * Phaser is really sensitive to errors, even a syntax error would mess up with the whole result. So I learned to read errors & pay attention to detail.
  * Attention to detail: spelling things correctly, adhering to syntax rules, etc
    * Paying attention to detail help me know what I did wrong & how I can fix the problem.
  * Growth mindset: patience, perseverance, and the courage to ask for help
    * Using Phaser takes a lot of patience. Whenever there's an error or a position error, I have to switch to each scene to view the result of my code. If I don't like it, I have to repeat the process.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
