# Entry 4: Our Math & Music Game (MVP)

## Content: Creating Our Game (MVP)

On February 10 and 11, Simran and I make our MVP Plan. MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product. Essentially, it means it's the least I can make that works.

On February 10, while working on our MVP Plan, we discussed on a name for our Math & Music game. On Discord, a instant messaging social platform, I give her some suggestions: Harmony Quest & Melody Mash. We decided that Harmony Quest is the better one. So our product, math & music game's name is **Harmony Quest**!

From February 17 to March 9, Simran and I made towards our MVP.

So far, this is what we made:

First, the game will ask the user/player his/her name. The user/player will enter his/her name. Then the user/player will use his/her mouse to click `OK`.

For example, if I am the user/player, I will enter "Nancy Chen" and click `OK` when done.

A message will pop up, saying "Welcome **using the user input from earlier**! To Harmony Quest!" The user/player can click `OK` when done.

For example, I entered "Nancy Chen" earlier. The message will print out "Welcome Nancy Chen! To Harmony Quest!" I will click `OK` when done.

A circular music notes background with a green play button will pop up. The user/player can click the play button, to play the game.

After the user/player clicked the green play button, it'll lead the user/player to the game instructions, which will tells the user/player how to play the game. Once the user/player is done reading them, the user/player can click the green start button.

After the user/player clicks the green start button, it will lead the user/player to the home scene, where there's many levels of the game. The user/player will choose any level they choose.

So far, each level has a message of "Welcome to Level #". And on the bottom, there's a text that will allow the user/player to go back to the home scene, where all the levels are, so the user/player can choose another level, if he/she so chooses.

My first resource is from my IDE/Github, where I make my music-game: [Link To Our Music & Math Game Code](https://github.com/simrans4258/music-game/tree/main).

My second resource is from my IDE/Github, where I wrote down my progress of what I did with my tool: [Link To My Learning Log](https://github.com/nancyc0337/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/learning-log.md).

My third resource is a website about Phaser: [Link To Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/).

My fourth source is Discord & Slack, where I can communicate & collaborate with my partner Simran: [Discord.com](https://discord.com/) & [Slack.com](https://slack.com/).

## Engineering Design Process

Right now in the Engineering Design Process(EDP), I am on the 5th step(Create a prototype) and the 6th step(Test and evaluate the prototype). We are creating a [MVP Plan](https://github.com/simrans4258/music-game/blob/main/prep/plan.md). We are using what we learned about our tool to create our [product](https://github.com/simrans4258/music-game/tree/main). Before finishing the product and moving on to the 8th step(Communicate the results), we will do the 7th step(Improve as needed).

## Skills

1) Collaboration & Communication

The 1st and 2nd skill I learned during this process is **Collaboration & Communication**.

While making our [project/game](https://github.com/simrans4258/music-game/tree/main), I have to communicate and collaborate with Simran. Since Simran has 3rd period SEP, I have 4th period SEP and we barely see each other in other classes, we used Discord and Slack to communicate and collaborate with each other. In Discord & SLack, we told each other of what we are going to do, when to git pull and git push the changes each other made, etc.

2) Attention to detail & Debugging

The 3rd and 4th skill I learned during this process is **Attention to detail & Debugging**.

When coding with Phaser, details are very important, if there's any small errors, the result wouldn't appear or the whole thing would collapse. I also have to know where the specific code goes.

3) Time Management & Problem Decomposition

The 5th and 6th skill I learned during this process is **Time Management & Problem Decomposition**.

We used the [MVP Plan](https://github.com/nancyc0337/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/prep/plan.md) to keep track of our time and tasks. We break the problem(creating the game) into smaller chunks/tasks.

## Summary

In conclusion, I will continue to work on the MVP with Simran to create our Harmony Quest game. We will create characters for the game, adding songs, and create many levels too. I can't wait to see the results!
