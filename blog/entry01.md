# Entry 1: Setting On My Tool & Project Idea For The Year-Long Freedom-Project

## Content: Setting On My Tool, Group & Project For My Freedom Project

The tool I decided on for this Freedom Project is **Phaser**. My backup tool is Kaboom.
I chose this topic because Phaser looks cooler than Kaboom. Phaser has components that almost looks like 3D, almost realistic and cute.

Even though, Kaboom's components can be editted but the things like sprites look like 2D and flat.

For this year's Year-Long Freedom Project, I wanted to work with someone else (as a team) because I don't want to work alone. Most importantly, I wanted to experience the skill of collaboration while working on this Freedom Project. I asked a lot of people but most of them wanted to work with someone else or they wanted to work alone. But on September 30, I founded someone that agreed to work with me. Simran Sayeed and Michelle Li said it's ok. After we confirmed on working together, we talked about it and we decided on making a math & music game. Simran Sayeed and I said we wanted to make a math & music game. Michelle Li said she wanted to make a game. Simran & I thought for a while and we thought of a game. We decided to make a game that have to do with Piano Tiles. But in order to play the music, we need to answer the math questions correctly. Simran Sayeed decided on the tool Earsketch. Michelle Li decided on the tool Anime.js. I decided on the tool Phaser. We will combine and use our tools to create our math & music game.

My fourth resource is a Phaser Tutorials playlist from Youtube that Mr. Mueller put in his document SEP11 Freedom Project Tool List: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list%3DPLDyH9Tk5ZdFzEu_izyqgPFtHJJXkc79no.

## Engineering Design Process

Right now in the Engineering Design Process(EDP), I am on the 1st(Define the problem), 2nd(Research the problem) and 3rd step(Brainstorm possible solutions).



## Skills

1) Collaboration: self-advocacy (asking for help), give/take within pair programming

The 1st skill I learned during this process is **Collaboration**.

2) Debugging: reading errors, tinkering, talking through the problem (RDD).

The 2nd skill I learned during this process is **Debugging**.

3) How to learn: technology changes fast. Some of the tools and languages you learn in SEP will probably become outdated. We often say #loyo, which means "Learn On Your Own."

The 3rd skill I learned during this process is **How To Learn**.

4) Growth mindset: patience, perseverance, and the courage to ask for help.

The 4th skill I learned during this process is **Growth Mindset**.

5) Embracing failure: rather than being discouraged by a bug or an error message, we love mistakes because they help us learn.

The 5th skill I learned during this process is **Embracing Failure**.

6) Attention to detail: spelling things correctly, adhering to syntax rules, etc.

The 6th skill I learned during this process is **Attention to Detail**.

## Summary
In conclusion, I'm excited to learn more about Phaser to help make the math & music game with my groupmates(Simran Sayeed and Michelle Li).

We will create our name for our math & music game.
