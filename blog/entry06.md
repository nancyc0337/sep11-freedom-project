### Expo Elevator Pitch
On May 23-26, we made our elevator pitch.
Elevator Pitch is a short, persuasive speech that one gives in order to create interest in something.

### In-class Presentations
During 5/19-5/22 and 5/27-5/29, my classmates and I presented our projects in front of the class. I presented on 5/22/2025.

Since Simran has 3rd period SEP 11, I went to her 3rd period to present with her. Since I had 4th period SEP 11, she went to my 4th period to present with me. In short, we presented twice to show both periods of what we made.

Takeaways:

From giving my SEP Expo elevator pitch and my in-class presentation, I learned
the skill `communication` and `collaboration`. During my SEP Expo and my in-class presentation, I was nervous. But I feel good and proud after showing others what I have made.

## Skills

1) Communication & Collaboration

The first & second skill I learned during this process is **Communication** and **Collaboration**.

The skill Communication is about articulating ideas to your partner, writing in your portfolio, public speaking in presentations, etc. The skill Collaboration is about self-advocacy (asking for help), give/take within pair programming, etc. Simran & I presented our elevator pitch in the SEP Expo and presentation in-class presentation(public speaking).

## Summary
In conclusion, I'm proud of what I made with Simran. I'm happy to accomplish this far with my partner.

I'm also thankful for the opportunity. After the SEP expo & on May 29, Mr. Mueller told us the ones that got the honorable mention and the 3 finalists that will present to others about our work. This year, Simran & I is one of the 3 finalists for SEP 11 Freedom Project! On June 6, Simran & I will present in the auditorium, periods 2 & 3 in front of students, teachers, friends, alumni, etc. Thanks Mr. Mueller.
