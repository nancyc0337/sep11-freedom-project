## Content: How We Finished Our MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

From March 10 to April 20, Simran and I worked towards our MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

We worked on our code for our Harmony Quest math & music game.

I worked on the game part using Phaser. My partner Simran, worked on the music part using EarSketch.

She sent me her link to her music.

She helped me download the music to a mp3 file so I can use the mp3 files in the code.

During my process coding with Phaser, I ran into lots of challenges:

My sixth source is Discord & Slack, where I can communicate & collaborate with my partner Simran: [Discord.com](https://discord.com/) & [Slack.com](https://slack.com/).

My seventh resource is from a website, where it helped me understand more about the concept of Phaser audio: [Link To The Phaser Audio](https://docs.phaser.io/phaser/concepts/audio).

My eighth resource is from a blog, where it showed me on how to select more than one character: [Link To The Select More Than One Character Blog](https://blog.ourcade.co/posts/2020/phaser-3-player-select-choose-character/).

My ninth resource is from a blog, where it showed me on Phaser buttons: [Link To The Phaser Buttons Blog](https://blog.ourcade.co/posts/2020/container-button-phaser-3-typescript-rxjs/).

## Engineering Design Process

Right now in the Engineering Design Process(EDP), I am on the 5th step(Create a prototype) and the 6th step(Test and evaluate the prototype). We are using what we learned about our tool to create our [product](https://simrans4258.github.io/music-game/). Before finishing the product and moving on to the 8th step(Communicate the results), we will do the 7th step(Improve as needed).

## Skills

1) Problem decomposition

2) Debugging

3) Communication & Collaboration

## Summary

In conclusion, I will continue to work on the Beyond MVP with Simran to make our Harmony Quest game even better. I can't wait to show my final result of our [game](https://simrans4258.github.io/music-game/)!
