# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Nancy Chen**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Phaser** in order to help me make **a math & music game called Harmony Quest**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Harmony Quest will award the **player** the music at the end of the level = prize (social)
* Harmony Quest provides math questions for the **player** to solve
* Harmony Quest can give whoever that likes math & music **entertainment**

##### CONS
* **People** can get distracted or addicted to this game.
* If the **player** gets the question wrong, the **player** might get mad.
